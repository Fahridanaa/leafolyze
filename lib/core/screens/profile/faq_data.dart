  FaqData(
    question: 'How accurate is the detection?',
    answer: 'The detection accuracy depends on the quality of the uploaded image and the disease severity. Our model has been trained on a large dataset and provides highly accurate results in most cases. However, for confirmation, it is always advised to consult with an agricultural expert.',
  ),
  FaqData(
    question: 'What should I do if the application cannot detect a disease?',
    answer: 'If the application cannot identify a disease, it may be due to an unclear image or an undetected disease type. Try capturing a clear image of the affected area or consult with an agricultural expert for further analysis.',
